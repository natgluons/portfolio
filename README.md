# Portfolio  

An interactive web portfolio showcasing my work, tools, and creative projects.  
Built both as preparation for my online CV and because I genuinely enjoy frontend development.  

## What This Portfolio Includes  

- **About Me**  
  A quick overview of what I do in AI, data, and creative coding.

  Tools, projects, and experiments spanning data science, AI applications, and frontend UI design.  

- **What I Post**  
  Updates on my coding projects, 3D art, and other creative work.  

## Features  

This portfolio is designed as more than a static siteâ€”itâ€™s an interactive playground with:  

- **Theme Toggle**: Switch between pink and black modes.  
- **Carousel**: Smooth sliding sections to display projects or media.  
- **Timeline**: A chronological view of experiences and projects.  
- **Expandable Buttons**: Interactive buttons that reveal hidden content.

- **Interactive Buttons & UI Handling**: Responsive and animated actions across components.  
- **And more**: Small design touches and interactions that make the site playful and engaging.  

## Purpose  

This portfolio isnâ€™t just a personal showcaseâ€”itâ€™s also a testing ground for frontend experiments. Iâ€™m using it to explore creative UI patterns and interactive elements while building something functional for my career.
